# VirtualPet
iOS swift develop lab2

I added two features into my app. 1) You can click bottom-right "task" to win bonus food for your pet. Once you start task, you have 5s to answer the true/false question. Correct answer will bring the food level up to full, otherwise you pet will be unhappy(-5 happiness). 2) you can see the pet level beside your pet which is represented by the combination of sun,moon and star. Level is related to the played times.
